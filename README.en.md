**Say one sentence to your agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes all work.**

<br>

3 to 30 minutes — you ship a **product launch animation**, a clickable App prototype, an editable PPT deck, a print-grade infographic.

Not "decent for AI" quality — it looks like a real design team made it. Give the skill your brand assets (logo, colors, UI screenshots) and it reads your brand's voice; give it nothing and the three-track design advisor plus 40 HTML-native styles still keep you out of AI slop territory.

**Every animation in this README was made by huashu-design itself.** No Figma, no After Effects — just a sentence + skill run. Next product launch needs a promo video? You can make it too.

```
npx skills add alchaincyf/huashu-design
```

Agent-agnostic — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, and Hermes can all use it.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add alchaincyf/huashu-design
```

> **Verify after install**: this skill is more than a single SKILL.md — the `references/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`, and `demos/` subdirectories hold 99 referenced recipes, scripts, and assets that the skill depends on. After installing, check the install path (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/huashu-design/`); if you only see SKILL.md and none of those subdirectories, your `skills` CLI is too old (≤1.5.15 had a bug that synced only the single file, fixed in 1.5.19). Upgrade and reinstall:
>
> ```bash
> npm i -g skills@latest        # or npx skills@latest add alchaincyf/huashu-design
> ```
>
> If it's still wrong after upgrading, fall back to a `git clone` install — clone the repo into any skills directory:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design.git ~/.claude/skills/huashu-design
> ```

Then talk to any compatible agent in your own language. The skill answers in the user's language unless asked otherwise:

```
"Make a keynote for AI psychology. Give me 3 style directions to pick from."
"Build an iOS prototype for a Pomodoro app — 4 screens, actually clickable."
"Turn this logic into a 60-second animation. Export MP4 and GIF."
"Run a 5-dimension expert review on this design."
```

No buttons, no panels, no Figma plugin. Agent-agnostic — drops into Claude Code, Cursor, Trae, Hermes, OpenClaw, or any markdown-skill-capable agent.

### Design Direction Advisor

Before any new visual design, the skill runs three complementary approaches in parallel: a 20-style random wheel that breaks habitual choices, migration from a real award-winning reference, and a best-fit world-class designer or studio. This hard gate still applies when the brief already names a style or brand; all three directions interpret the same context differently. The skill produces three actual visual versions before asking the user to choose. Underneath is a library of 40 HTML-native styles: 20 for websites and 20 for slide decks.

### iOS App Prototype

Pixel-accurate iPhone 15 Pro body (Dynamic Island / status bar / Home Indicator) · state-driven multi-screen navigation · real images pulled from Wikimedia/Met/Unsplash · Playwright click tests before delivery.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design/releases/download/v2.0/c1-ios-prototype-en.gif" width="100%"></p>

### Motion Design Engine

Stage + Sprite time-slice model · `useTime` / `useSprite` / `interpolate` / `Easing` — four APIs cover every animation need · one command exports MP4 / GIF / 60fps-interpolated / BGM-scored finals.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design/releases/download/v2.0/c3-motion-design-en.gif" width="100%"></p>

### HTML Slides → Editable PPTX

HTML decks for browser presentation · `html2pptx.js` reads DOM computed styles and translates each element into real PowerPoint objects · exports are **actual text frames**, not image-bed fakes.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design/releases/download/v2.0/c2-slides-pptx-en.gif" width="100%"></p>

### Tweaks · Live Variation Switching

Colors / typography / information density parameterized · side panel toggle · pure-frontend + `localStorage` persistence · survives reload.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design/releases/download/v2.0/c4-tweaks-en.gif" width="100%"></p>

### Infographic / Data Viz

Magazine-grade typography · precise CSS Grid columns · `text-wrap: pretty` typographic details · driven by real data · exports to vector PDF / 300dpi PNG / SVG.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design/releases/download/v2.0/c5-infographic-en.gif" width="100%"></p>

### 5-Dimension Expert Critique

Philosophical coherence · visual hierarchy · execution craft · functionality · innovation — each scored 0–10 · radar-chart visualization · outputs Keep / Fix / Quick Wins punch list.

### Junior Designer Workflow

No heroic one-shot attempts: start with assumptions + placeholders + reasoning, show it to the user early, then iterate. Fixing a misunderstanding early is 100× cheaper than fixing it late.

### Core Asset Protocol · 5-step hard process

Mandatory whenever the task involves a specific brand: ask → search → download (three fallback paths) → verify + extract → write `brand-spec.md` covering **logo, product shots, UI screenshots, colors, fonts** — all required assets, not just colors.

## Showcase · Real Projects

### Parrot Evolution Website · Three-Track Design Advisor in Practice (2.0)

> **Live demo · [https://www.huasheng.ai/parrots/](https://www.huasheng.ai/parrots/)**

The only brief was "make a website about the evolution of parrots." With no additional direction, the skill ran the full 2.0 advisor workflow: it first determined that images were essential to the content, sourced public-domain natural-history illustrations by Edward Lear and John Gould, then produced three real visual versions in parallel through the random style wheel, an award-winning real-world reference, and Kenya Hara's *White* philosophy. Assets came first; the design was not built around color-block placeholders.

### "Let's Talk About Skills" · PM After-Party Presentation Deck

> **Live demo · [https://skill-huasheng.vercel.app](https://skill-huasheng.vercel.app)**

A 13-slide HTML deck created entirely with Huashu Design:

- A restrained black-background serif system spanning cover, about, hook, what, why, and closing slides.
- Two 22-second cinematic demos with BGM and SFX for the Nüwa and Darwin skill workflows, each with a completely independent visual language:
  - **Nüwa:** 3D knowledge orbit, pentagonal distillation, SKILL.md typewriter, and a "21 minutes" hero reveal.
  - **Darwin:** autoresearch loop spin, side-by-side v1/v5 diff, full-screen hill-climb curve, and ratchet-gear lock.
- Each cinematic defaults to a complete static workflow dashboard so the audience can inspect how the skill works. Pressing ▶ starts the animation; completion fades back to the dashboard.
- A localized iframe fallback for the 25-second hero animation from huasheng.ai.
- Real data: a 14,495-star historical curve from the GitHub API and DeepSeek V4 specifications verified through web research.
- Real AI assets: a 4×2 grid generated with `huashu-gpt-image`, split by `extract_grid.py` into eight transparent PNGs, and arranged in a floating 3D orbit.

**Useful reference pages:**

- `/slides/slide-04b-nuwa-flow.html` · static dashboard plus cinematic-overlay architecture.
- `/slides/slide-06b-darwin-flow.html` · a contrasting case with a fully independent visual language.
- `/slides/slide-03b-deepseek-cover.html` · side-by-side comparison of AI slop and a genuine designer viewpoint.

See `references/cinematic-patterns.md` for the detailed cinematic patterns.

## Core Mechanics

### Core Asset Protocol

The hardest rule in the skill. When the task touches a specific brand (Stripe, Linear, Anthropic, DJI, your own company, etc.), five steps are enforced:

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Ask | Checklist of 6 asset types: logo / product shots / UI screenshots / color palette / fonts / brand guidelines | Respect existing resources |
| 2 · Search official channels | `<brand>.com/brand` · `<brand>.com/press` · `brand.<brand>.com` · product pages · launch films | Find authoritative assets |
| 3 · Download by asset type | Logo (SVG → inline-SVG in HTML → social avatar) · Product shots (hero → press kit → launch video frames → AI-generated from reference) · UI (App Store screenshots → official video frames) | Three fallback paths per asset type |
| 4 · Verify + extract | Check logo fidelity · product image resolution · UI freshness · grep color hex from real assets | **Never guess from memory** |
| 5 · Freeze to spec | Write `brand-spec.md` with logo paths, product image paths, UI screenshot paths, CSS variables for colors/fonts | Un-frozen knowledge evaporates |

**Ranking of asset importance** (from the skill's internal rubric):

1. Logo — mandatory for any brand
2. Product renders — mandatory for physical products
3. UI screenshots — mandatory for digital products
4. Color values — auxiliary
5. Fonts — auxiliary

A/B-tested (v1 vs v2, 6 agents each): **v2 reduced stability variance by 5×**. Stability of stability — that's the real moat.

### Design Direction Advisor (Fallback)

Required before every new visual design, including briefs that already specify a style or brand. It is skipped only when the user explicitly asks to skip it, when iterating on a direction already approved in the same project, or for a purely mechanical non-design operation:

- Clarify the brief conversationally and proactively request references: project name, logo, brand colors, and websites the user likes.
- Acquire all content-critical real images first from public-domain or royalty-free sources.
- Run three complementary approaches in parallel, each producing a real visual version: (1) a second-based random wheel that selects 1 of 20 styles and breaks the model's minimalist bias, (2) migration from a world-class award-winning website, deck, or iOS prototype, and (3) the philosophy of the best-fit designer or studio if budget were unlimited.
- Never ask the user to choose a visual direction before showing visuals. Put all three versions side by side and let the user choose from evidence.
- Continue into the Junior Designer workflow after the direction is selected.
- Use the 40-style HTML-native library (20 web + 20 slide styles, grouped as bold, neutral, and quiet) as a source of options, not doctrine.

### Junior Designer Workflow

The default working mode across every task:

- Send the full question set in one batch, wait for all answers before moving
- Write assumptions + placeholders + reasoning comments directly into the HTML
- Show it to the user early (even if just gray blocks)
- Fill in real content → variations → Tweaks — show at each of these three steps
- Manually eyeball the browser with Playwright before delivery

### Fact Verification First (Principle #0)

The highest-priority rule, added after a real failure mode: when the task mentions a specific product / technology / event (e.g., "DJI Pocket 4", "Nano Banana Pro", "Gemini 3 Pro"), the first action **must** be a `WebSearch` to confirm existence, release status, current version, and specs. No claims from training-corpus memory. Cost of a search: ~10 seconds. Cost of a wrong assumption: 1–2 hours of rework.

### Anti AI-slop Rules

Avoid the visual common denominator of AI output (purple gradients / emoji icons / rounded-corner + left border accent / SVG humans / Inter-as-display / **CSS silhouettes standing in for real product shots**). Use `text-wrap: pretty` + CSS Grid + carefully chosen serif display faces + oklch colors.

## vs. Claude Design

I'll be upfront: the Core Asset Protocol's philosophy was lifted from system prompts Anthropic wrote for Claude Design. That prompt hammers home a single idea — **great hi-fi design doesn't start from a blank page, it grows from existing design context**. That one principle is the difference between a 65-point design and a 90-point design.

Positioning differences:

| | Claude Design | huashu-design |
|---|---|---|
| Form | Web product (used in browser) | Skill (used in Claude Code) |
| Quota | Subscription quota | API usage · parallel agents unblocked |
| Output | Canvas + Figma export | HTML / MP4 / GIF / editable PPTX / PDF |
| Interaction | GUI (click, drag, edit) | Conversation (tell agent, wait) |
| Complex animation | Limited | Stage + Sprite timeline · 60fps export |
| Agent compatibility | Claude.ai only | Claude Code / Cursor / Trae / Hermes / OpenClaw |

Claude Design is a **better graphics tool**. Huashu-design makes **the graphics-tool layer disappear**. Two paths, different audiences.

---

## Limitations

- **No layer-editable PPTX-to-Figma round-trip.** The output is HTML — screenshottable, recordable, image-exportable, but not draggable into Keynote for text-position tweaks.
- **Framer-Motion-tier complex animations are out of scope.** 3D, physics simulation, particle systems exceed the skill's boundaries.
- **Brand-from-zero design quality drops to 60–65 points.** Drawing hi-fi from nothing was always a last resort.

This is an 80-point skill, not a 100-point product. For people unwilling to open a graphical UI, an 80-point skill beats a 100-point product.

## Origin Story

The day Anthropic launched Claude Design I played with it until 4 a.m. A few days later I realized I hadn't opened it once since — not because it's bad (it's the most polished product in the category) but because I'd rather have an agent work in my terminal than open any graphical UI.

So I had an agent deconstruct Claude Design itself (including the system prompts circulating in the community, the brand asset protocol, the component mechanics), distill it into a structured spec, then write it as a skill installed in my own Claude Code.

Thanks to Anthropic for writing the Claude Design prompts so clearly. This kind of derivative work inspired by other products is the new form of open-source culture in the AI era.
